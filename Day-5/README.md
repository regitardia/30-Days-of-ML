What You’ll Learn
In Lesson 4 (Lists), you’ll learn how to use Python lists to store ordered collections of values. Lists are incredibly useful when writing code to manage several related variables.

In Lesson 5 (Loops and List Comprehensions), you’ll learn an efficient way to repeatedly execute code. With list comprehensions, you’ll often be able to condense code that would have taken several lines to just a single line!
